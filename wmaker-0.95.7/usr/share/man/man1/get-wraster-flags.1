.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBget-wraster-flags\fP used to provide the compilation and link flags for programs that use
the \fIWRaster\fP library, before \fBpkg-config\fP became the universal way to handle these
developer configurations. The script is now deprecated and you should use instead:
.TP
.BR pkg-config " wrlib \fI\-\-cflags\fP"
to get the flags for the compiler
.TP
.BR pkg-config " wrlib \fI\-\-libs\fP"
to get the flags for the linker
.SH "IMPORTANT NOTE"
As with every deprecated stuff, the script \fBget-wraster-flags\fR will be removed soon,
so you should update your script quickly while you know about it.
